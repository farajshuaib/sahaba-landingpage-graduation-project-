        <p>Risk Warnings.</p>

        <p>
          Any investments carry risks as well as rewards and you should always
          bear the following in mind: the value of investments and the income
          from them may go down as well as up and you may not get back the
          amount you originally invested; past performance is not a reliable
          indicator of future results; emerging markets are volatile and may
          suffer from liquidity problems; changes in rates of exchange between
          currencies may cause the value of or income from investments to
          decrease or increase; and funds which specialise in a particular
          region or sector are more risky than those which hold a very broad
          spread of investments.&nbsp;
