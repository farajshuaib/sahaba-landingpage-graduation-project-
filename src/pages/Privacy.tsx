              We‍ implement a variety of security measures to maintain the
              safety of your personal information. We use a secure server,
              Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and encrypt the data into our
              gateway provider's database only to be accessible by those
              authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are
              required to keep the information confidential. We have enforced
              internal data privacy policies regarding all the personal data you

              We‍ implement a variety of measures to ensure that our processing
              systems remain confidential, resilient and available.
              Specifically, we have implemented processes to help ensure high
              availability, business continuity and prompt disaster recovery. We
              commit to maintaining strong physical and logical access controls
              and conduct regular penetration testing to identify and address
              potential vulnerabilities.

              The website utilizes properly provisioned servers (e.g. multiple
              load balancers, web servers, replica databases) in case of
              failure. We take servers out of operation as part of regular
              maintenance, without impacting availability. We keep encrypted
              backups of data daily. In the case of production data loss (i.e.
              primary database loss), we will restore organizational data from
              these backups. Only designated, authorized operations team members
              have access to configure the infrastructure on an as-needed basis.
              Specific private keys are required for individual servers, and
              keys are stored in a secure and encrypted location.
